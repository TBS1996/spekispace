-- this is just me rambling to myself about possible future features so i dont forget it


# collections

a collection is a set of card references. cards may be chosen dynamically (e.g. dependencies of a card), and cards added manually.
for dynamically added cards, they may only use properties of cards that are not specific to a user when cards later can be shared. So nothing about the recall/review state of the card, or if it's suspended or not.

multiple collections may reference the same card.

a collection may reference another collection as long as there's no cycles. 

# review sort

like the algorithm use to determine the review priority. so for example recall rate, min recall etc..
it should return something like an Option<f32>, meaning, whether it should be reviewed at all, and if it should, its priority


# review 

reviewing will be done by choosing two items

one is the collection of cards that will be reviewed.

the other is the predicate which may contain things like recall rate, stability, suspended status etc..

for simplicity sake there should be a collection which contains all cards.

hmm maybe we should allow metadata stuff like suspended since we can tie it to the user, i guess we'll have both user-level metadata and global one for cards?


# shared cards

users should be able to share cards so that others can download it and use it and share references

would make sense they submit an entire collection at a time. it'll also push all the dependencies of the collection.

maybe have a github repo that has all the shared cards, and when user press share it creates a PR there that me or others will approve or make suggestions for?
at least for the "global map". 

or maybe no global map and instea deverybody just share collections and can search for each other's collections and reference each other and hopefully organically 
people will converge to one big map since they can reference each other

a challenge here though is how to deal with referencing other collections if the original card is updated or something?
hmm.. i think easiest just let people handle these dependencies themselves, so if you're not happy with how the original guy remade it then you just gotta change your reference

maybe i'll also have a global map that's like more static or smth ? like when people converge on certain collections and they have a high standard i can move them into a global map that's more static
and then i'll have the responsibility for them and the original creator cannot change it so it's more "safe" to use it by others?


# recall rate calculation

should move into using ML for determining recall rate, can just feed a lot of the reviews into a model lol

# expected gain 

lets say current stability is 50

if at a given point you succeed in recall it'll become 130
if at that point you fail, the new stability is 20

let's say the recall rate at that point is 0.8

expected gain = (0.8 * 120) + ((1 - 0.8) * 20) - 50 = 58

we can sort cards based on their expected gain so you know which reviews give you most benefit
maybe also multiply with the priority of the card

limitations:
- it's greedy, so, maybe the optimum long term strategy is not to just take the one with highest expected gain 
- maybe it'll be biased to long or short term ? could be fixed by having a time horizon variable where you can bias certain information to near or long term stability

for example if you're learning two languages, maybe one you need to use 6 months from now and another you have no specific plans it'll bias more to near-term stability for first one and long term for 2nd one

# smart watch integration?

maybe can integrate smart watch data into the app so users can see how well their memory affected by things like sleep recovery exercise


# extension vs intension classes

extension classes can have instances where the instance itself is also a class. is the same also true for intension classes?
